# Pablo Pérez

Hey 👋, I'm Pablo, a Junior Software Developer. I'm currently improving my knowledge on Go, Python, TypeScript and React to be able to produce modern websites and apps. I'm also learning Docker and Kubernetes (containerization in general) to be able to deploy applications and managing servers efficiently.

I am an Advanced Technician in Application Development, and I have worked with stacks made with Java + Spring Boot and C# + .NET in the back end, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for the front end. 

I'm employed right now while pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering. I'm dedicated to making computers accesible for everyone and teaching people how to use them.

I'm interested in CLI applications, text editors, Linux, open-source software, cloud applications, Docker, books, vintage items, plants, otters and cats. 🦦

Software I use:
- OS: NixOS
- Browser: Brave Browser
- Text editor: neovim
- Window Manager: bspwm
